# Predicates
* Stable or unstable sort [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability]

# List of all possible sorts

## Simple sorts
* Insertion sort
* Selection sort
* Bubble sort

## Efficient sorts
* Merge sort
* Heap sort
* Quick sort
* Shell sort
* Team sort [???]

## Distribution sorts
* Counting sort (Works only for `finite set` of values)
* Bucket sort (Counting + partitioning array)
* Radix sort (by processing dogits)
* Quantum sort [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_sort]
* American flag sort
* Bead sort
* Burstsort
* Interpolation sort
* Pigeonhole sort
* Proxmap sort
* Flashsort [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashsort]
  Good for uniformly distributed data sets

## Concurrent sorts
* Bitonic sorter
* Batcher odd-even mergesort
* Pariwise Sorting network
* Sorting network

## Algorithms like Merge sort
* Merge-insertion sort [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge-insertion_sort]
  Also known as `Ford and Johnson sort`. It's also minimal comparisons sort in the worst case.
* Barcher odd-even mergesort
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcher_odd%E2%80%93even_mergesort]

## Algorithms like Insertion sort
* Gnome sort (StupidSort) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_sort]
* Library sort[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_sort]
* Splaysort
* Tree sort
* Patience sorting

## Algorithms like Selection sort
* Smoothsort
* Cartesian tree sort
* Tournament sort
* Cycle sort
* Weak-help sort

## Algorithms like Bubble sort
* Comb sort
* Cocktail shaker sort (bidirectional bubble sort)

## Hybrids Merge sort + Insertion Sort
* Insertion sort on small arrays

# Others

* Topological sort (Pre-topological order)
* Bead sort
* Simple pancake sort [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting](Pancake_sort)
  Related to `pancake problem` and `pancake graphs`
* Spaghetti (Poll) sort
* Bogosort (random shuffling and checking for sorted)
* Stooge sort (stooge initial of the list 2/3 then final 2/3 then intial 2/3)
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stooge_sort](Stooge_sort) (Why 2/3 ?)
